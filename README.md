### Decision Tree Classification models to predict employee turnover

In this project I have attempted to create supervised learning models to assist in classifying certain employee data.

The objective of this project was to focus on splitting data, feature importance, training classifiers and reviewing results via a basic accuracy function and confusion matrices. Some code structures were based on a Coursera MOOC called [Data-driven Astronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy/home/welcome) by The University of Sydney and subsequently modified for my purposes. I had not come across confusion matrices before, so this course was handy for this and practising working with numpy arrays.
